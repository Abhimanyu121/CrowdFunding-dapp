# CrowdFunding-dapp

## Challenge Description

The challenge is to create a crowdfunding application where the backend is an Ethereum smart contract, and the frontend is an application hosted on Arweave. This creates a completely decentralized crowdfunding app with a verifiable and immutably published project plan.

Current crowdfunding platforms have a problem. Creators ask for funds to complete a project, but once funded, we donâ€™t always see the expected results. This new crowdfunding app should work to prevent this.

The creator asking for funds should set a deadline for raising 100% of the funds. The funds will be split into creator-defined batches, with each batch being linked to a milestone. If the full amount isn't raised, the balance is automatically returned to the project backers.

- Once fully funded, the project starts.

- The first batch of funds is released to the creator to start the project.

- The creator publishes a report at the end of each milestone. If a majority (perhaps a majority with a quorum, or supermajority) of backers are unsatisfied with the progress, they can then vote to suspend the project, stop future payouts, and return the remaining funds to the backers. If completed, the next batch is released to the creator.

- Follow the same rules until all milestones are completed, and all funds have been distributed, or until backers vote to suspend the project.

## Submission Requirements

* You should aim for a viable permaweb-based app with the smart contract fully respecting the challenge description.

* The project needs to be open-source and released on GitHub for us to review the entire source.
